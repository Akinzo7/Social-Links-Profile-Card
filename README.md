## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google font



### What I learned

To be honest i still struggle with layout and styling. I had to do a little bit of revision on some css display properties to be able to solve this, however i still stumble on some hindrances but i Used chatgpt for clarifification and now i understand where the problem is.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I need to still learn more in-depth about css display properties like flexbox, grid and reponsive design. It's a gradual process and step-by-step i will get better.I can only get better.
