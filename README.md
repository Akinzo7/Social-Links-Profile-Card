## My process



### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google font



### What I learned

To be honest, I still struggle with layout and styling. I had to do a little bit of revision on some CSS display properties to be able to solve this; however, I still stumble on some hindrances but I used ChatGPT for clarification, and now I understand where the problem is.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

I need to still learn more in-depth about CSS display properties like flexbox, grid and responsive design. It's a gradual process, and step by step, I will get better. I can only get better.
